<h2>Mac</h2><hr>
<p>The MacBook is a brand of notebook computers manufactured by Apple Inc. from May 2006 to February 2012, and relaunched in 2015.
 It replaced the iBook series and 12-inch PowerBook series of notebooks as a part of the Apple-Intel transition from PowerPC. 
 Positioned as the low end of the MacBook family, below the premium ultra-portable MacBook Air and the powerful MacBook Pro,[1] the MacBook was aimed at the consumer and education markets.
  It was the best-selling Macintosh ever. For five months in 2008, it was the best-selling laptop of any brand in US retail stores.
  Collectively, the MacBook brand is the "world's top-selling line of premium laptops."
There have been four separate designs of the MacBook.
The original model used a combination of polycarbonate and fiberglass casing which was modeled after the iBook G4.
The second type was introduced in October 2008 alongside the 15-inch MacBook Pro; the MacBook shared the more expensive laptop's unibody aluminium casing, but omitted FireWire. 
A third design, introduced in late 2009, had a polycarbonate unibody casing. 
A new, redesigned MacBook line was launched on March 9, 2015.
Available in silver, gold or space grey, it is thinner than the MacBook Air and removes the traditional MagSafe charging port (along with all other ports, except the headphone jack) in favor of the multi-purpose USB-C port. 
It also features a Retina display. 
On April 19, 2016, Apple updated the 12-inch Retina MacBook with new sixth-generation Intel Core M processors, longer battery life and a rose gold option;
on June 5, 2017, the MacBook also received seventh-generation Intel Core processors and the second-generation butterfly keyboard that debuted on the MacBook Pro.

    <h2>iPad</h2><hr>
    <p>iPad is a line of tablet computers designed, developed and marketed by Apple Inc., which run the iOS mobile operating system.
    The first iPad was released on April 3, 2010; the most recent iPad models are the iPad (2018), released on March 27, 2018, the 10.5-inch (270 mm) and 12.9-inch (330 mm) 2nd generation iPad Pro released on June 13, 2017. 
    The user interface is built around the device's multi-touch screen, including a virtual keyboard. All iPads can connect via Wi-Fi; some models also have cellular connectivity. 
    As of May, 2017, Apple has sold more than 360 million iPads, though sales peaked in 2013. 
    It is the most popular tablet computer by sales as of the second quarter of 2018.
    An iPad can shoot video, take photos, play music, and perform Internet functions such as web-browsing and emailing. Other functions – games, reference, GPS navigation, social networking, etc. – can be enabled by downloading and installing apps. 
    As of March, 2016, the App Store has more than one million apps for the iPad by Apple and third parties. There have been four versions of the iPad Mini, all of which have a screen size of 7.9 inches (20 cm). 
    The first generation has similar internal specifications to the iPad 2 but uses the Lightning connector instead. The iPad Mini 2 added the Retina Display, the Apple A7 processor, and the Apple M7 motion coprocessor, closely matching the internal specifications of the iPad Air. 
    The iPad Mini 3 added the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. The iPad Mini 4 features the Apple A8 and the Apple M8 motion coprocessor. 
    There have been two generations of the iPad Pro. The first generation came with 9.7" and 12.9" screen sizes, while the second came with 10.5" and 12.9" sizes. The iPad Pros have unique features such as the Smart Connector, which are exclusive to this series of iPads.

        <h2>iPhones</h2><hr>
        <p>
        iPhone is a line of smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc. The iPhone line of products use Apple's iOS mobile operating system software. The first-generation iPhone was released on June 29, 2007, and multiple new hardware iterations with new iOS releases have been released since.
        The user interface is built around the device's multi-touch screen, including a virtual keyboard. The iPhone has Wi-Fi and can connect to cellular networks. An iPhone can shoot video (though this was not a standard feature until the iPhone 3GS), take photos, play music, send and receive email, browse the web, send and receive text messages, follow GPS navigation, record notes, perform mathematical calculations, and receive visual voicemail. 
        Other functionality, such as video games, reference works, and social networking, can be enabled by downloading mobile apps. As of January 2017, Apple's App Store contained more than 2.2 million applications available for the iPhone.
        Apple has released eleven generations of iPhone models, each accompanied by one of the eleven major releases of the iOS operating system. The original first-generation iPhone was a GSM phone and established design precedents, such as a button placement that has persisted throughout all releases and a screen size maintained for the next four iterations. 
        The iPhone 3G added 3G network support, and was followed by the 3GS with improved hardware, the 4 with a metal chassis, higher display resolution and front-facing camera, and the 4S with improved hardware and the voice assistant Siri. The iPhone 5 featured a taller, 4-inch display and Apple's newly introduced Lightning connector. In 2013, Apple released the 5S with improved hardware and a fingerprint reader, and the lower-cost 5C, a version of the 5 with colored plastic casings instead of metal. 
        They were followed by the larger iPhone 6, with models featuring 4.7-and-5.5-inch (120 and 140 mm) displays. The iPhone 6S was introduced the following year, which featured hardware upgrades and support for pressure-sensitive touch inputs, as well as the SE—which featured hardware from the 6S but the smaller form factor of the 5S. In 2016, Apple unveiled the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, which add water resistance, improved system and
        graphics performance, a new rear dual-camera setup on the Plus model, and new color options, while removing the 3.5 mm headphone jack found on previous models. 
        The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were released in 2017, adding a glass back and an improved screen and camera. The iPhone X was released alongside the 8 and 8 Plus, with its highlights being a near bezel-less design, an improved camera and a new facial recognition system, named Face ID, but having no home button, and therefore, no Touch ID. 
        In September 2018, Apple again released 3 new iPhones, which are the iPhone XS, an upgraded version of the since discontinued iPhone X, IPhone XS Max, a larger variant with the series' biggest display as of 2018 and iPhone XR, a lower end version of the iPhone X.
        The original iPhone was described as "revolutionary" and a "game-changer" for the mobile phone industry. Newer iterations have also garnered praise, and the iPhone's success has been credited with helping to make Apple one of the world's most valuable publicly traded companies.

            <h2>Watches</h2><hr>
            <p>
            Apple Watch is a line of smartwatches designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. It incorporates fitness tracking and health-oriented capabilities with integration with iOS and other Apple products and services.
            Apple Watch relies on a wirelessly connected iPhone to perform many of its default functions such as calling and texting. 
            However, Wi-Fi chips in all Apple Watch models allow the smartwatch to have limited connectivity features away from the phone anywhere a Wi-Fi network is available. Series 3 LTE Apple Watches are able to be used without needing to be consistently connected to an iPhone,
            though an iPhone is still required to set up the device. Most Apple Watches that are currently produced require an iPhone 5s or later with iOS 11; the Series 3 LTE model requires an iPhone 6 or later with iOS 11.
            The Apple Watch was released on April 24, 2015 and quickly became the best-selling wearable device with 4.2 million sold in the second quarter of the 2015 fiscal year.
            The second generation of Apple Watches were released in two tiers in September 2016: the Apple Watch Series 1 and Apple Watch Series 2, while the first generation was discontinued.
            The Apple Watch Series 3 was released on September 22, 2017 alongside the discontinuation of the Apple Watch Series 2.[21]
            The Apple Watch Series 4 was announced on September 12, 2018, with the Apple Watch Series 1 no longer being sold.[22] 
            The goal of the Apple Watch was to enhance the uses of an iPhone while also providing the user with some additional new features.[23] Kevin Lynch was hired by Apple to make wearable technology for the wrist. He said: 
            "People are carrying their phones with them and looking at the screen so much. People want that level of engagement. But how do we provide it in a way that's a little more human, a little more in the moment when you’re with somebody?"[23] Apple's development process was held very much under wraps until a Wired article revealed how some internal design decisions were made.
